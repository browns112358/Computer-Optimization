-Hunt down data for cost of living (save it as .xlsx format, please)

-Start to parse through the data we have and organize it (to be done in the main.m)

-Figure out how to associate data.  Create a Script to put all the data associated with one county together. 
For example if one file has a population of x for Albany. and another has a crime rate of y for 'albany'.  
Create a script (or do it manually) that can associate a population of x and a crime rate of y both with the key, "Albany".

-Create a script that can take the locations (in long, lat format) and compute a 'remoteness factor' 
for each town.  This should take into account how far it is from other towns and the population of those 
towns.
